Here is a list of some selected projects that I think would be good to show students as examples of meaningful digital humanities work. I am beginning this list on May 10, 2020 and don't have much time because I have to deposit this capstone/thesis before May 15th and it ain't finished yet!!! So these are just some thoughts. I will add more. Please send me suggestions of projects you think should be included to write to me at **springle@ccny.cuny.edu** or [https://github.com/binipringle](https://github.com/binipringle)

Students will not have an internet connection. Therefore, projects that can be run on a local server are ideal. Websites that can be archived and taken to prison on a USB drive will also work.

[Archipelagos](https://archipelagosjournal.org/) \| a journal of Caribbean digital praxis

archipelagos is a born-digital, peer-reviewed publication devoted to creative exploration, debate, and critical thinking about and through digital practices in contemporary scholarly and artistic work in and on the Caribbean. Given the wide implications of the “digital turn” for our very conceptions of knowledge, our mission is to discern the ways in which the digital may enhance and transform our comprehension of the regional and diasporic Caribbean. archipelagos responds to this challenge with three distinct dimensions of critical production: scholarly essays; digital scholarship projects; and digital project reviews.

[Torn Apart/Separados](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/volume/2/index)

Volume 2 of Torn Apart is a deep and radically new look at the territory and infrastructure of ICE’s financial regime in the USA. This data & visualization intervention peels back layers of culpability behind the humanitarian crisis of 2018.

[The Early Caribbean Digital Archive](https://ecda.northeastern.edu/)

The Early Caribbean Digital Archive is an open access collection of pre-twentieth-century Caribbean texts, maps, and images. Texts include travel narratives, novels, poetry, natural histories, and diaries that have not been brought together before as a single collection focused on the Caribbean. Plantation slavery and settler colonialism are defining aspects of the early Caribbean—both sit at the origin of the modern capitalist world. The texts and images collected here tell the story of European imperial domination, and of the enslaved African and Indigenous American people whose lives, labor, and land shaped the culture and development of the Atlantic world. The materials in the archive are primarily authored and published by Europeans, but the ECDA aims to use digital tools to "remix" the archive and foreground the centrality and creativity of enslaved and free African, Afro-creole, and Indigenous peoples in the Caribbean world.

[The Covid Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) and [The Covid Racial Data Tracker](https://covidtracking.com/race)

The COVID Tracking Project is a volunteer organization launched from The Atlantic and dedicated to collecting and publishing the data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Every day, it collects data on COVID-19 testing and patient outcomes from all 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia. Its dataset is currently in use by national and local news organizations across the US and by research projects and agencies worldwide. As of mid-April, its data API (which allows sites and apps to import our dataset automatically) receives about one million requests per day.

On April 15, The Covid Tracking Project launched the COVID Racial Data Tracker, a partnership between the COVID Tracking Project and the The Antiracist Research & Policy Center that collects, publishes, and analyzes racial data on the pandemic within the United States.
