<p>
  DH in Prison is a minimal computing project for teaching digital humanities in prison. This site is built with Ed, a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> theme designed for textual
  editors based on <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing principles</a>, and
  focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. Ed's underlying technology is easy to
  learn and teach, and can produce beautifully rendered scholarly or reading editions of texts meant
  to last. To start using Ed, please see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/">its
  documentation</a> for installation instructions and more. To learn more about the ideas behind Ed
  and a list of current features see its <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">about</a> section.
