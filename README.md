## About

"Introduction to Digital Humanities" is a one semester 3-credit course that aims to introduce students to the landscape of digital humanities tools and methods through readings and classroom and online discussions, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students will explore a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into their academic research. In addition, they will explore both the general field and a particular area of interest to them, produce a series of digital projects individually and in collaboration with fellow students, and learn how to present their digital work effectively.

As a minimal computing project this course lives on a static Jekyll site so that it can be used on a fairly simple computer network with no internet connection. Students will learn digital skills as well as tools and methods for exploring humanities subjects and doing humanistic research. Students will learn version control (git), HTML and CSS, Python, and Jekyll (Ruby).

Most of the course materials and resources are on the [Intro to DH](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/) course site and in this repository. To clone and generate the course site on your local computer see the documentation.md file or the [Documentation](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/documentation/) page.  Some other resources such as digital editions of texts and datasets are listed in the [Teaching Notes](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/texts/teaching-notes/) and in files in this repository.

Programs needed on student laptops for technical skills sessions are listed in the documentation.md file and the [Documentation](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/documentation/) page.
