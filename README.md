# Intro to DH
## a minimal computing project for teaching digital humanities in prison

## About

"Introduction to Digital Humanities" is a model for a one semester 3-credit course that aims to introduce students in college-in-prison to the landscape of digital humanities tools and methods through readings and classroom and online discussions, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Its aim is to help students explore a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into their academic research, and learn the digital skills they need to get started. Students will learn to use the command line, version control (Git), HTML and CSS, Python, and Jekyll (Ruby). In addition, they will produce a series of digital projects individually and in collaboration with others, and learn how to present their digital work effectively.

This course is on a static site. It can be used on a fairly simple computer network with no internet connection.

This site is built with <a href="http://elotroalex.github.io/ed//">Ed.</a>, a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> theme built with <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing principles</a>, and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. To use <a href="http://elotroalex.github.io/ed//">Ed.</a>, see its documentation.

Most of the course materials and resources are on the [Intro to DH](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/) course site and in this repository. To clone and generate the course site on your local computer see the documentation.md file or the [Documentation](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/documentation/) page.  Some other resources such as digital editions of texts and datasets are listed in the [Teaching Notes](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/texts/teaching-notes/) and in files in this repository.

Programs needed on student laptops for technical skills sessions are listed in the documentation.md file and the [Documentation](https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/documentation/) page.
