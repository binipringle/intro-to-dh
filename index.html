<p>
  "Introduction to Digital Humanities" is a one semester course that aims to introduce students to the landscape of digital humanities through readings, classroom and online discussions, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students will explore a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into their academic research, and will acquire the technical skills they will need to do this. In addition, students will explore both the general field and a particular area of interest to them, produce a series of digital projects individually and in collaboration with fellow students, and learn how to present their digital work effectively.</p>
<p>
  This course is designed to run on a simple computer network with no internet connection. Students will learn to use the command line, version control (git), HTML and CSS, Python, and Jekyll (Ruby). These basic technical skills can serve students as a first step towards gaining expertise in areas such as software design, mapping, data visualization, games, artificial intelligence, text mining, UX design and other specializations.</p>

<p>
  Most course materials and resources are on this static site. The technical toolkit sessions / tutorial sessions / technical tutorial sessions / technical sessions (I'm not sure what to call these) are aimed at providing students with the technical skills they will need for this course. Readings are in the library on the other site (gulp) or in the other section of this site (hm how to) and the glossary provides definitions of new, noteworthy and tech-specific terms. Other resources such as digital editions of texts, datasets and images will be brought in by the instructor upon request. All requests have to be screened and approved by the prison, so it is a good idea to request resources as soon as you know what you might need.
