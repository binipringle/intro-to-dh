<p>
  "Intro to DH" is a one semester undergraduate college level course that aims to introduce incarcerated students to digital humanities theory and praxis. Students will critically evaluate and use digital technologies in their academic work, create digital projects, and acquire the necessary technical skills to do this. No prior technical knowledge is required. This course is designed to be generated on and served from a laptop to student laptops connected to each other via a local area network, with no connection to the internet.</p>

<p>
  As described in the <a href="https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/asyllabus/">syllabus</a>, most course materials and resources are on this static site. The technical skills sessions will show students how to use the command line, version control (Git), HTML and CSS, Python, and Jekyll (Ruby). Some readings are on this site and others will be supplied. Additional collections, texts, datasets, and images that students request for their projects will also be made available as allowed.
