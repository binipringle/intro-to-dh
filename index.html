<p>
  "Introduction to Digital Humanities" is a one semester course that aims to introduce students to the landscape of digital humanities through readings and classroom and online discussions, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students will explore a broad range of ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into their academic research. In addition, they will explore both the general field and a particular area of interest to them, produce a series of digital projects individually and in collaboration with fellow students, and learn how to present their digital work effectively.</p>
<p>
  As a minimal computing project this course is designed to run on a fairly simple computer network with no internet connection. Students will learn version control (git), HTML and CSS, Python, and Jekyll (Ruby). These technical skills can be foundational for gaining expertise in software design, mapping, data visualization, games, artificial intelligence, text mining, UX design and other specializations in subsequent semesters.</p>

<p>Most course materials and resources are on this website. The toolkit sessions are aimed at providing you with the technical skillset you will need for this course. The glossary provides definitions of new, noteworthy and tech-specific terms. Readings are in the library on the other site (gulp) or in the other section of this site (hm how to). Other resources such as digital editions of texts, datasets and images will be brought in by the instructor when you request them for a project. All requests have to be screened and approved by the prison, so it is a good idea to request resources as soon as you know what you might need.
