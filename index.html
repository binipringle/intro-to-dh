<p>
  "Intro to DH" is a one semester course that aims to introduce students in college-in-prison to the landscape of digital humanities through readings, classroom and online discussions, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students will explore ways to critically evaluate and use digital technologies in their academic work, and will acquire the necessary technical skills to do this.</p>

<p>
  This course is on a static site built with Jekyll. It is designed to be generated on and served from a laptop to student laptops on a local area network with no connection to the internet.</p>

<p>
  As described in the <a href="https://binipringle.github.io/intro-to-dh/asyllabus/">syllabus</a>, most course materials and resources are on this static site. The technical skills sessions will show students how to use the command line, version control (Git), HTML and CSS, Python, and Jekyll (Ruby). Some readings are on this site and others will be supplied. Additional collections, texts, datasets, and images that students request for their projects will also be made available as allowed.
