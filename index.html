<p>
  "Introduction to Digital Humanities" is a one semester course that aims to introduce students to the landscape of digital humanities through readings, classroom and online discussions, hands-on workshops, and collaborative projects. Students will explore ways to critically evaluate and incorporate digital technologies into their academic research, and will acquire the necessary technical skills to do this.</p>
<p>
  This course is designed for students in prison and will be delivered on laptops joined by a local area network with no need for an internet connection. Students will learn to use the command line, version control (git), HTML and CSS, Python, and Jekyll (Ruby). Mastering these technical skills can be a first step towards gaining expertise in software design, mapping, data visualization, games, publishing, artificial intelligence, text mining, UX design and other specializations.</p>

<p>
  Most course materials and resources are on this static site. The technical skills sessions will show you how to use the tools you will need for this course. Some readings are on this site and others will be brought in by the instructor. The instructor will also bring in digital humanities projects and collections, texts, datasets and images, and resources you request for your projects. All requests will have to be screened and approved by the prison, so it is a good idea to request resources as soon as you know what you need.
