This capstone project for the Master of Arts in Digital Humanities at The Graduate Center - CUNY grew out of a conversations in the Introduction to Digital Humanities course I took in Fall 2018, about how digital humanities had shifted from seeing itself in its early days as a big tent[^1] to becoming an expanded field[^2] and then allying itself with social justice advocates, activists, organizers, and others to bring about social change.[^3]

At the same time that I was learning new skills that gave me a lot of freedom to criss-cross between different academic fields and public spheres, I became increasingly aware that all this criss-crossing was making boundaries more fluid and less clearly defined. Excited by the vitality new voices were injecting into academic conversations and convinced that all the reshuffling we were doing was good, I wanted to help further expand the field of digital humanities by sharing the tools I was learning with the most underserved. At the time, I was tutoring in a federal prison in New York City, where I was struck by the complete absence of digital technologies used to pursue educational goals. I saw that on one hand digital literacy would be super important to students when they left prison and set out to seek jobs. In addition to this, I found that going into the back end of a computer and telling it to do what I wanted - instead of going in with the fear that I would break the damn thing - so mesmerizing, fun and empowering that I wanted to share my exciting new skills with my students and employ these practices in prison as pedagogical tools. When we have fun, we engage and we learn. There was no doubt in my mind that the freedom and freshness of digital humanities theory and practice would appeal to incarcerated students. The question was never why, only how.

Minimal computing work done by digital humanists provided the answer to this question. Minimal computing is an emerging conversation in digital humanities about the need for computing solutions in parts of the world with little or no internet connectivity and limited access to digital technologies. This lack of access as well as the steep learning curve that generally accompanies it excludes a huge part of the world population from being able to participate in digital work. The goal of minimal computing is to seek ways to use computers under significant constraints of hardware, software, connectivity, education, network capacity, power, or other factors, to increase access and thus include otherwise excluded people in digital scholarship and digital work.  Minimal computingâ€™s search for solutions revolves around the central question of what is needed and explores how to meet these needs at minimal cost. It aims to be sustainable, reasonably easy to program and able to preserve digital work at low cost and independently. To my excitement, I found that these goals exactly met this project's needs.
