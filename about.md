This capstone project for the Master of Arts in Digital Humanities at The Graduate Center - CUNY grew out of a conversations in the intro to DH course in Fall 2018 about how digital humanities had shifted from, in its early days, seeing itself as a big tent (link to Patrick Svensson, "Beyond the Big Tent") to becoming an expanded field (Link to Lauren F. Klein and Matthew K. Gold, "Digital Humanities: The Expanded Field"), to ally itself with activists, organizers, and others to bring about social change (link to Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein, "A DH That Matters").

At the same time that I was learning new skills that gave me a lot of freedom to criss cross academic fields, I became increasingly aware that this criss-crossing was making the boundaries between academic communities and other public spheres more fluid and less clearly defined. Excited by the vitality new voices were injecting into academic conversations and convinced that all the reshuffling we were doing was good, I wanted to help further expand the field of digital humanities by sharing the tools I was learning with the most underserved. At the time, I was tutoring in a federal prison in New York City, where I was struck by the complete absence of digital technologies used to pursue educational goals. I saw that on one hand digital literacy would be super important to my students when they left prison and set out to seek jobs. In addition to this, I found getting into the back end of a computer and getting it to do what I wanted it to do - instead of being scared I'd break the damn thing because I didn't know how it worked - so mesmerizing, fun and empowering that I wanted to employ these practices in prison as pedagogical tools. When we have fun, we engage and we learn. Meeting the challenge of just the right amount of difficulty creates appetite for more. There was no doubt in my mind that the freedom and freshness of digital humanities theory and practice would appeal to incarcerated students. The question was never why, only how.

Minimal computing work done by digital humanists provided the answer to this question. Minimal computing is an emerging conversation in digital humanities about the need for computing solutions in parts of the world with little or no internet connectivity and limited access to digital technologies. This lack of access to digital technologies as well as the steep learning curve generally required by these excludes a huge part of the world population from being able to participate in digital work. The goal of minimal computing is to seek ways to use computers under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors.  Minimal computingâ€™s search for solutions revolves around the central question of what is needed and explores how to meet these needs at minimal cost. It aims to be sustainable, reasonably easy to program and able to preserve digital work at low cost and independently. To my excitement, I found that these goals exactly meet this project's needs.
