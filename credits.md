### [Graduate Center Digital Initiatives](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) | City University of New York (CUNY)

Graduate Center Digital Initiatives (GCDI) Digital Fellows created the technical skills sessions which were adapted for this project. Specifically, this project is indebted to Patrick Smyth, Kelsey Chatlosh, Mary Catherine McKinniburgh, and Jojo Karlin. (I will add more) GCDI brings together the work of leading scholars and technologists at the CUNY Graduate Center to pioneer new modes of inquiry that integrate digital tools and methods into the research, teaching, and service missions of the university.

## Acknowledgments

As many open source projects, Ed is the work of community. The project starts with the open web, and everything in between leading to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the wonderful team who wrangled that Ruby in our favor. The theme stylesheets are built on top of [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a Jekyll theme based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), "the Jekyll butler," both created by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) and distributed with an MIT license. Thanks, Mark, for your helpful streamlining! Special hat tips to brother-in-markdown-arms, [Chris Forster](https://github.com/c-forster), and the generous [Sylvester Keil](https://github.com/inukshuk/) for his work on Jekyll Scholar.


We are strongly indebted to the research work and conversations stemming out of our [Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/)—or as we like to call it: #xpmethod; the wonderful international comradery of [GO::DH](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/); and of course, the support of our [Columbia University Libraries](http://library.columbia.edu/) and its cozy [Studio@Butler](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/).

### [Alex Gil](http://www.elotroalex.com/) | Resident minimalist

He is vice chair of the [Global Outlook::Digital Humanities](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/) initiative focusing on minimal computing and translation, is one of the founders and directors of [Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/) and the [Studio@Butler](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/), and is actively engaged in several digital humanities projects at Columbia and around the world. He created Ed., the Jekyll theme this site is built with. We are really grateful for the excellent documentation in Ed.

...and to the writers that inspire us to scribble notes on the margins we protect with our work. Thank you.
