## Acknowledgments

As many digital humanities projects, DH in Prison/Intro to DH builds upon the work of community. I am strongly indebted to the the CUNY Graduate Center [Digital Humanities Program](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Digital-Humanities) for facilitating many gatherings, workshops, events and conversations that informed my work. I want to particularly thank my thesis advisor Matthew K. Gold who encouraged me, inspired me, helped me develop and scope my ideas, and supported me along the way. I am deeply grateful to Patrick Smyth for his encouragement and support (Patrick told me back in 2018 that this project "has legs," which, coming from Patrick, meant a great deal to me) and for kindling in me, through his awesome pedagogy, a real love for coding and exploring the affordances of digital tools for doing meaningful humanities work. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the [GC Digital Fellows](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) who welcomed me weekly in their office hours, helped me when I got stuck, taught me in their workshops and always generously shared their expertise, with particular thanks to Javier Otero Peña, Olivia Ildefonso, Filipa Calado and Rafael Davis Portelo. I want to thank Lisa Marie Rhody for her encouragement and advice and for organizing the GC DHRI, which is a model that guides this project in many ways. I am grateful to Alex Gil, Marii Nyröp and the [Global Outlook::Digital Humanities](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/) for conversations and work which informed and guided mine.

I also want to extend my sincere thanks to my fellow student and friend Carolyn McDonough, who listened to me, gave me lots of ideas, supported me and shared much-needed comic relief in our conversations about hair shirts and implanted valves. And I want to thank Ilian David Sanchez Rodriguez and Gisella Lopez Bautista for their ongoing support and for jumping in with their awesome art work.

Last but not least, I want to thank the students I tutored at Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn for helping me understand some of the things that they need.
