## Questions & answers 1 - digital humanities fundamentals

What is the Digital Humanities? Digital Humanities refers to new modes of scholar-ship and institutional units for collaborative, trans-disciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publication.Digital Humanities is less a unified field than an array of convergent practices that explore a universe in which print is no longer the primary medium in which knowledge is produced and disseminated. Digital tools, techniques, and media have expanded traditional concepts of knowledge in the arts, humanities and social sciences, but Digital Humanities is not solely “about” the digital (in the sense of limiting its scope to the study of digital culture). Nor is Digital Humanities only “about” the humanities as traditionally understood since it ar-gues for a remapping of traditional practices. Rather, Digital Humanities is defined by the opportunities and challenges that arise from the conjunction of the term digital with the term humanities to form a new collective singular.The opportunities include redrawing the boundary lines among the humanities, the social sciences, the arts, and the natural sciences; expanding the audience and social impact of scholarship in the humanities; developing new forms of inquiry and knowledge production and reinvigorating ones that have fallen by the wayside; training future genera-tions of humanists through hands-on, project-based learning as a complement to classroom-based learn-ing; and developing practices that expand the scope, enhance the quality, and increase the visibility of humanistic research.The challenges include addressing fundamental questions such as: How can skills traditionally used in the humanities be reshaped in multimedia terms? How and by whom will the contours of cultural and historical memory be defined in the digital era?  How might practices such as digital storytelling coincide with or diverge from oral or print-based storytelling? What is the place of humanitas in a networked world?What defines the Digital Humanities now?The computational era has been underway since World War II, but after the advent of personal com-puting, the World Wide Web, mobile communication, and social media, the digital revolution entered a new phase, giving rise to a vastly expanded, global-ized public sphere and to transformed possibilities for knowledge creation and dissemination.Building on the first generation of computational humanities work, more recent Digital Humanities activity seeks to revitalize liberal arts traditions in the electronically inflected language of the 21st century: a language in which, uprooted from its long-standing paper support, text is increasingly wedded to still and moving images as well as to sound, and supports have become increasingly mobile, open, and extensible.And the notion of the primacy of text itself is being challenged. Whereas the initial waves of com-putational humanities concentrated on everything from word frequency studies and textual analysis (classification systems, mark-up, encoding) to hypertext editing and textual database construction, contemporary Digital Humanities marks a move beyond a privileging of the textual, emphasizing graphical methods of knowledge production and organization, design as an integral component of re-search, transmedia crisscrossings, and an expanded concept of the sensorium of humanistic knowledge. It is also characterized by an intensified focus on the building of transferrable tools, environments, and platforms for collaborative scholarly work and by an emphasis upon curation as a defining feature of scholarly practice.What isn’t the Digital Humanities?The mere use of digital tools for the purpose of humanistic research and communication does not qualify as Digital Humanities. Nor, as already noted, is Digital Humanities to be understood as the study of digital artifacts, new media, or contemporary culture in place of physical artifacts, old media, or historical culture.On the contrary, Digital Humanities understands its object of study as the entire human record, from prehistory to the present. This is why fields such as classics and archaeology have played just as impor-tant a role in the development of Digital Humanities as has, for example, media studies. This is also why some of the major sectors of Digital Humanities research extend outside the traditional core of the humanities to embrace quantitative methods from the social and natural sciences as well as techniques and modes of thinking from the arts. 
Questions & answerssg3sgWhere does the Digital Humanities come from?The roots of computational work in the humani-ties stretch back to 1949 when the Jesuit scholar Roberto Busa, working in collaboration with IBM, undertook the creation of an automated approach to his vast Index Thomisticus, a computer-generated concordance to the writings of Thomas Aquinas. By means of such early uses of mainframe computers to automate tasks such as word-searching, sorting, counting, and listing, scholars could process textual corpora on a scale unthinkable with prior methods that relied on handwritten or typed index cards. Other early projects included the debut, in 1966, of Computers and the Humanities, the first specialized journal in the field. Seven years later, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) was founded, with the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) following in 1978.By the mid-1980s computational methods for linguistic analysis had become widespread enough that protocols for tagging digital texts were needed. This spurred the development of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). This important undertaking reshaped the field of electronic textual scholarship and led subsequent digital editing to be carried out in Ex-tensible Markup Language (XML), the tag scheme of which TEI is a specialized subset. The first human-ities-based experiments with database structures and hypertextual editing structured around links and nodes (rather than the linear conventions of print) date from this period, as do the many pilot projects in computational humanities in the United States  sponsored by the National Endowment for  the Humanities and other agencies, organizations,  and foundations.How do the Web and other networks affect the Digital Humanities?As this revolution in protocols was taking place, the explosion of personal computing in the mid-1980s combined with the advent of the World Wide Web a decade later gave rise to a new generation of Digital Humanities work that was less text-centered and more design-driven. The desktop environment—with its graphical user interface, real-time WYSIWYG tool-kit, and evolution from command lines to icons and window-based frames—not only vastly expanded the corpus of born-digital documents but also ushered in the gradual integration of audio, video, and graphics.This integration has matured over the past decades and given Web culture its profoundly multi-medial character. It also favored the enhancement of models of sharing, co-creation, publication, and community-building that have situated the Web at the center of contemporary social debates and socio-economic processes. The concept of the  Web as a public sphere that extends the physical public spaces of contemporary life has, of course, been intensified thanks to smartphones, tablets,  and other ubiquitous and pervasive computing and  media devices.What is ahead for the Digital Humanities?Contemporary Digital Humanities stands not in op-position to the past, but on its shoulders. It honors the pioneering labors carried out over the past seven decades in the form of statistical processing (com-putational linguistics), linking (hypertext), modeling (architectural and visual displays), the creation of structured data (XML), and iterative editing and ver-sion control (for critical editions as well as analysis and creative practices), even as it seeks to move be-yond repository building and editing to new synthetic practices. It is inspired by the same core conviction that animated computational humanities and early Digital Humanities pioneers: the conviction that computational tools have the potential to transform the content, scope, methodologies, and audience of humanistic inquiry.
