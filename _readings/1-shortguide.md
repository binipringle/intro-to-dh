Digital Humanities refers to new modes of scholarship and institutional units for collaborative, trans-disciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publication.

Digital Humanities is less a unified field than an array of convergent practices that explore a universe in which print is no longer the primary medium in which knowledge is produced and disseminated. Digital tools, techniques, and media have expanded traditional concepts of knowledge in the arts, humanities and social sciences, but Digital Humanities is not solely “about” the digital (in the sense of limiting its scope to the study of digital culture). Nor is Digital Humanities only “about” the humanities as traditionally understood since it argues for a remapping of traditional practices. Rather, Digital Humanities is defined by the opportunities and challenges that arise from the conjunction of the term digital with the term humanities to form a collective singular.

# What aren't digital humanities?

The mere use of digital tools for the purpose of humanistic research and communication does not qualify as Digital Humanities. Nor, as already noted, is Digital Humanities to be understood as the study of digital artifacts, new media, or contemporary culture in place of physical artifacts, old media, or historical culture.

On the contrary, Digital Humanities understands its object of study as the entire human record, from prehistory to the present. This is why fields such as classics and archaeology have played just as important a role in the development of Digital Humanities as has, for example, media studies. This is also why some of the major sectors of Digital Humanities research extend outside the traditional core of the humanities to embrace quantitative methods from the social and natural sciences as well as techniques and modes of thinking from the arts.

Like traditional humanities-based research and teaching, Digital Humanities work involves practices of analysis, critique, and interpretation; editing and annotation; historical research and contextualization. It examines the formal and historical properties of works of the imagination, the interplay of self and society, the history of ideas and of material culture. It attends to qualitative and non-quantifiable features of the human experience: complexity, ambiguity, medium specificity, and subjectivity. It builds on traditional approaches to the study, preservation, and classification of cultural corpora.

# How are digital humanities discontinuous with traditional forms of research and teaching in the humanities?

For nearly six centuries, humanistic models of knowledge have been shaped by the power of print as the primary medium of knowledge production and dissemination. Rather than rejecting print culture or embracing the simple pouring of print models into digital molds, Digital Humanities is engaged in developing print-plus and post-print models of knowledge. Both involve more than an updating of the knowledge delivery system. They entail the cognitive and epistemological reshaping of humanistic fields as a function of the affordances provided by the digital with respect to print. They also respect the increasing role teamwork and collaboration play in humanities research and training.
