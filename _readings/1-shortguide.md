*## Questions & answers 1 - Digital Humanities fundamentals ##*

# What is the Digital Humanities?

Digital Humanities refers to new modes of scholarship and institutional units for collaborative, trans-disciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publication.

Digital Humanities is less a unified field than an array of convergent practices that explore a universe in which print is no longer the primary medium in which knowledge is produced and disseminated.

Digital tools, techniques, and media have expanded traditional concepts of knowledge in the arts, humanities and social sciences, but Digital Humanities is not solely “about” the digital (in the sense of limiting its scope to the study of digital culture). Nor is Digital Humanities only “about” the humanities as traditionally understood since it argues for a remapping of traditional practices. Rather, Digital Humanities is defined by the opportunities and challenges that arise from the conjunction of the term digital with the term humanities to form a new collective singular.

The opportunities include redrawing the boundary lines among the humanities, the social sciences, the arts, and the natural sciences; expanding the audience and social impact of scholarship in the humanities; developing new forms of inquiry and knowledge production and reinvigorating ones that have fallen by the wayside; training future generations of humanists through hands-on, project-based learning as a complement to classroom-based learning; and developing practices that expand the scope, enhance the quality, and increase the visibility of humanistic research.

The challenges include addressing fundamental questions such as: How can skills traditionally used in the humanities be reshaped in multimedia terms? How and by whom will the contours of cultural and historical memory be defined in the digital era? How might practices such as digital storytelling coincide with or diverge from oral or print-based storytelling? What is the place of *humanitas* in a networked world?

# What defines the Digital Humanities now?

The computational era has been underway since World War II, but after the advent of personal computing, the World Wide Web, mobile communication, and social media, the digital revolution entered a new phase, giving rise to a vastly expanded, globalized public sphere and to transformed possibilities for knowledge creation and dissemination.

Building on the first generation of computational humanities work, more recent Digital Humanities activity seeks to revitalize liberal arts traditions in the electronically inflected language of the 21st century: a language in which, uprooted from its long-standing paper support, text is increasingly wedded to still and moving images as well as to sound, and supports have become increasingly mobile, open, and extensible.

And the notion of the primacy of text itself is being challenged. Whereas the initial waves of computational humanities concentrated on everything from word frequency studies and textual analysis (classification systems, mark-up, encoding) to hypertext editing and textual database construction, contemporary Digital Humanities marks a move beyond a privileging of the textual, emphasizing graphical methods of knowledge production and organization, design as an integral component of research, transmedia crisscrossings, and an expanded concept of the sensorium of humanistic knowledge. It is also characterized by an intensified focus on the building of transferrable tools, environments, and platforms for collaborative scholarly work and by an emphasis upon curation as a defining feature of scholarly practice.

# What isn’t the Digital Humanities?

The mere use of digital tools for the purpose of humanistic research and communication does not qualify as Digital Humanities. Nor, as already noted, is Digital Humanities to be understood as the study of digital artifacts, new media, or contemporary culture in place of physical artifacts, old media, or historical culture.

On the contrary, Digital Humanities understands its object of study as the entire human record, from prehistory to the present. This is why fields such as classics and archaeology have played just as important a role in the development of Digital Humanities as has, for example, media studies. This is also why some of the major sectors of Digital Humanities research extend outside the traditional core of the humanities to embrace quantitative methods from the social and natural sciences as well as techniques and modes of thinking from the arts.

# Where does the Digital Humanities come from?

The roots of computational work in the humanities stretch back to 1949 when the Jesuit scholar Roberto Busa, working in collaboration with IBM, undertook the creation of an automated approach to his vast *Index Thomisticus*, a computer-generated concordance to the writings of Thomas Aquinas. By means of such early uses of mainframe computers to automate tasks such as word-searching, sorting, counting, and listing, scholars could process textual corpora on a scale unthinkable with prior methods that relied on handwritten or typed index cards. Other early projects included the debut, in 1966, of Computers and the Humanities, the first specialized journal in the field. Seven years later, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) was founded, with the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) following in 1978.

By the mid-1980s computational methods for linguistic analysis had become widespread enough that protocols for tagging digital texts were needed. This spurred the development of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). This important undertaking reshaped the field of electronic textual scholarship and led subsequent digital editing to be carried out in Extensible Markup Language (XML), the tag scheme of which TEI is a specialized subset. The first humanities-based experiments with database structures and hypertextual editing structured around links and nodes (rather than the linear conventions of print) date from this period, as do the many pilot projects in computational humanities in the United States sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and other agencies, organizations, and foundations.

# How do the Web and other networks affect the Digital Humanities?

As this revolution in protocols was taking place, the explosion of personal computing in the mid-1980s combined with the advent of the World Wide Web a decade later gave rise to a new generation of Digital Humanities work that was less text-centered and more design-driven. The desktop environment — with its graphical user interface, real-time WYSIWYG tool-kit, and evolution from command lines to icons and window-based frames — not only vastly expanded the corpus of born-digital documents but also ushered in the gradual integration of audio, video, and graphics.

This integration has matured over the past decades and given Web culture its profoundly multi-medial character. It also favored the enhancement of models of sharing, co-creation, publication, and community-building that have situated the Web at the center of contemporary social debates and socio-economic processes. The concept of the  Web as a public sphere that extends the physical public spaces of contemporary life has, of course, been intensified thanks to smartphones, tablets, and other ubiquitous and pervasive computing and media devices.

# What is ahead for the Digital Humanities?

Contemporary Digital Humanities stands not in opposition to the past, but on its shoulders. It honors the pioneering labors carried out over the past seven decades in the form of statistical processing (computational linguistics), linking (hypertext), modeling (architectural and visual displays), the creation of structured data (XML), and iterative editing and version control (for critical editions as well as analysis and creative practices), even as it seeks to move beyond repository building and editing to new synthetic practices. It is inspired by the same core conviction that animated computational humanities and early Digital Humanities pioneers: the conviction that computational tools have the potential to transform the content, scope, methodologies, and audience of humanistic inquiry.

## Questions & answers 2 - the project as basic unit

# Why projects?

Projects are both nouns and verbs: A project is a kind of scholarship that requires design, management, negotiation, and collaboration. It is also scholarship that projects, in the sense of futurity, as something which is not yet. Projects are often pursued in teams, with collaborators bringing complementary skill-sets and interests to conceptualize the research questions being investigated and design possible trajectories for them to be answered. Hence, projects are projective, involving iterative processes and many dimensions of coordination, experimentation, and production.

# Who is involved in Digital Humanities projects?

Digital Humanities projects typically involve multiple circles of researchers, from faculty and staff to students and community partners. A project’s complexity and scale generally implies the involvement of multiple strata of personnel from within and across institutions of learning.

Projects can involve partner institutions such as museums, libraries, and archives as well as members of the community, alumni, and members of interested virtual networks such as collectors, amateur historians, and the like.

Partnerships with corporations, in particular media and technology companies, are also possible, with a caveat that corporate and academic cultures may be different in their goals and values.

# How are Digital Humanities projects organized?

Projects are usually faculty-, staff-, or student-initiated. They are often built around a research question and/or a university collection or archival repository. Many take place outside the classroom; others involve a research project that is anchored in a recurring course.

A Principal Investigator (or, PI), co-PIs, project advisors, staff, interns, and students are all part of the project team. It is the responsibility of the PI to organize the project team, establish timelines for deliverables, and assess the project at each stage of development.

# What is the difference between Digital Humanities projects and Big Humanities projects?

Digital Humanities projects come in all sizes: big, medium, and small. Some of the defining early Digital Humanities projects, however, as well as prominent contemporary work have assumed the form of Big Humanities projects, which are realized over many years, with many contributors, developers, and funders involved at various stages of development. Big Humanities projects are built along the lines of Big Science. They involve large-scale, long-term, team-based initiatives that build big pictures out of the tesserae of expert knowledge.The researchers and team members, from historians to technologists to designers, may number in the hundreds.

Little or “lowercase” Digital Humanities projects are typically carried out by individuals or small teams in consultation with experienced staff. As standard platforms and protocols have emerged, editing, exhibit-building, network analysis, and repository development require less one-off investment.

The bulk of Digital Humanities projects fall in between the two ends of the spectrum.

# How is the Digital Humanities continuous with traditional forms of research and teaching in the humanities?

Like traditional humanities-based research and teaching, Digital Humanities work involves practices of analysis, critique, and interpretation; editing and annotation; historical research and contextualization. It examines the formal and historical properties of works of the imagination, the interplay of self and society, the history of ideas and of material culture. It attends to qualitative and non-quantifiable features of the human experience: complexity, ambiguity, medium specificity, and subjectivity. It builds on traditional approaches to the study, preservation, and classification of cultural corpora.

Though the range of media with which Digital Humanities works extends beyond the textual, its core commitments harmonize with the long-standing values of the humanistic tradition: the pursuit of analytical acuity and clarity, the making of effective arguments, the rigorous use of evidence, and communicative expressivity and efficacy. Digital Humanities then melds hands-on work with vastly expanded data sets, across media and through new couplings of the digital and the physical, resulting in definitions of and engagements with knowledge that encompass the entire human sensorium.

Both the traditional classroom and solitary study remain key features in the landscape of Digital Humanities learning. At the same time, many precedents for collaborative work in communities of letters and knowledge networks are enhanced by digital platforms in a fabric animated by opportunities for hands-on, project-based learning. Since antiquity, the dominant models of humanistic inquiry have favored an understanding of intellectual labor as solitary and contemplative, cut off from—and even superior to—manual labor and the realm of making or doing. Digital Humanities re-embeds these models in an augmented model of pedagogy that emphasizes learning through making and doing, whether on the level of the individual or the group.

# How is the Digital Humanities discontinuous with traditional forms of research and teaching in the humanities?

For nearly six centuries, humanistic models of knowledge have been shaped by the power of print as the primary medium of knowledge production and dissemination. Rather than rejecting print culture or embracing the simple pouring of print models into digital molds, Digital Humanities is engaged in developing print-plus and post-print models of knowledge. Both involve more than an updating of the knowledge delivery system. They entail the cognitive and epistemological reshaping of humanistic fields as a function of the affordances provided by the digital with respect to print. They also respect the increasing role teamwork and collaboration play in humanities research and training.

# How does the Digital Humanities function in the print-plus era?

Print typically offers a single viewing angle, linear organization, a research output characterized by finitude and stability, and a scale of documentation and argumentation that has to respect the physical proportions of the book. The digital print-plus era, in contrast, allows for toggling back and forth between multiple views of the same materials. It allows for fluid scale shifts, for “zooming” from the macro- to the micro-level, and for the interweaving of data sets (such as source materials, notes, and correspondence) into research outputs. The screens and augmented spaces of the print-plus era allow for the faceting, filtering, and versioning of corpora; for the coexistence of multiple pathways within a single repository; for multilinear forms of argument. It is extensible in the double sense of allowing for seemingly unlimited scale and of being process- rather than product-based. When a book goes to print, it stabilizes in an edition that has to be reissued in order to be revised; a digital artifact can be altered or revised on a rewritable substrate that supports rapid refresh rates. The same digital artifact can lead multiple lives on multiple platforms, with multiple authors. It can undergo remixing by others before, during, and after its “completion.”

# How are Digital Humanities projects funded and sustained?

Because they cross over boundaries between disciplines; between theoretical and applied knowledge; and among the humanities, library science, information technology, and design, Digital Humanities projects typically require support structures that cut across conventional department and school organizational lines. Private foundations, public granting agencies, and industry partners have all provided monies for projects at every scale.

Funding for research in the humanities is far more limited than in the science and engineering fields, but the scope and innovative character of the Digital Humanities have led many projects to successfully garner external funding. In order to attract and sustain such funding, it has proven essential for projects to receive internal support during a period of incubation so that they may prove their worth by successfully reaching an initial set of benchmarks.

Sustaining such projects requires that faculty and students who assume leadership positions need the support and recognition that this work is a combination of research, teaching, and service.

# What are the prevailing crediting and attribution conventions and authorship models for Digital Humanities projects?

Traditional authorship and crediting practices in the humanities are based on single authorship. Although practices of attribution are still fluid in the Digital Humanities community, the emerging model recognizes that many, if not most, Digital Humanities projects are analogous either to natural science laboratory projects or to the collaborative attribution system used in the performing arts.  No standardized crediting system for Digital Humanities projects has been embraced universally. But the dominant trend is toward the differentiation of roles such as principal investigator, researcher, designer, programmer, modeler, editor, and the like.
