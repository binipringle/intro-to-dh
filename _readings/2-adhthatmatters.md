Because incarcerated students do not usually have access to the internet, they will not be able to read "A DH That Matters" by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein in *Debates in the Digital Humanities* on Manifold. We are writing to the University of Minnesota Press to request permission to reproduce the full text on the college-in-prison course site, so that students can read it offline.

Non-incarcerated readers with internet connections can read ["A DH That Matters"](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/0cd11777-7d1b-4f2c-8fdf-4704e827c2c2#intro/) for free on Manifold.  

We chose to assign this introduction to the most recent edition of *Debates in the Digital Humanities*, published in 2019, before the introductions to earlier editions, because it speaks urgently to the important role digital humanities work can play and is playing now, at this stricken time. Then, to explore the progression of ideas that led to these thoughts, we will back track in time and read ["Digital Humanities: The Expanded Field,"](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/14b686b2-bdda-417f-b603-96ae8fbbfd0f#intro/) the 2016 introduction to *Debates in the Digital Humanities* also by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein. After that we will go even further back and read ["The Digital Humanities Moment"](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/fcd2121c-0507-441b-8a01-dc35b8baeec6#intro/) by Matthew K. Gold, published in 2012, to compare and enjoy.
