Because incarcerated students do not usually have access to the internet, they will not be able to read "A DH That Matters" by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein in *Debates in the Digital Humanities* on Manifold. We are writing to the University of Minnesota Press to request permission to reproduce the full text on the college-in-prison course site, so that students can read it offline.

Non-incarcerated readers with internet connections can read ["A DH That Matters"](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/0cd11777-7d1b-4f2c-8fdf-4704e827c2c2#intro/) for free on Manifold.  

We chose to assign this introduction to the 2019 edition of *Debates in the Digital Humanities* because it speaks to the important role digital humanities work is playing now and future roles it can play. To contextualize and situate this thought piece in a larger conversation, students will go on to read ["Digital Humanities: The Expanded Field,"](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/14b686b2-bdda-417f-b603-96ae8fbbfd0f#intro/), by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein in 2016, and then, still moving backwards in time, ["The Digital Humanities Moment"](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/fcd2121c-0507-441b-8a01-dc35b8baeec6#intro/) by Matthew K. Gold in 2012.
