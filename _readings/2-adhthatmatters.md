Note: because incarcerated students usually do not have access to the internet, they will not be able to access the readings we selected from Debates in the Digital Humanities (Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein, Editors) on Manifold. We are therefore writing to the University of Minnesota Press to request permission to reproduce the full text in the course site for college-in-prison, so that students can read it offline.

Non-incarcerated readers with internet connections can read these selections for free on Manifold. The first text we will read is:

![A DH That Matters (2019)](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/0cd11777-7d1b-4f2c-8fdf-4704e827c2c2#intro)   

We chose to assign the introduction to the most recent edition of Debates in the Digital Humanities, published in 2019, before the introductions to earlier editions which we also assign. In order to put this introduction in context and to see how thinking about DH has changed over the last few years, the next reading on the syllabus is the introduction to the 2016 edition of Debates in the Digital Humanities, "Digital Humanities: The Expanded Field" by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein. After that we will go further back in time and read the introduction to the first edition of Debates in the Digital Humanities published in 2012, "The Digital Humanities Moment" by Matthew K. Gold.
