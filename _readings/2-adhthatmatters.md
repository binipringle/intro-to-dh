Because incarcerated students do not usually have access to the internet, they will not be able to read "A DH That Matters" by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein in *Debates in the Digital Humanities* on Manifold. We are writing to the University of Minnesota Press to request permission to reproduce the full text on the college-in-prison course site, so that students can read it offline.

Non-incarcerated readers with internet connections can read "A DH That Matters" for free on Manifold.

We chose to assign this introduction to the most recent edition of *Debates in the Digital Humanities*, published in 2019, before the introductions to earlier editions. In order to contextualize and see how the authors' thoughts about DH have changed over the last few years, the following reading on the syllabus is the introduction to the earlier 2016 edition of *Debates in the Digital Humanities*, "Digital Humanities: The Expanded Field," also by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein. After that we will go further back in time and read "The Digital Humanities Moment" by Matthew K. Gold, published in 2016.
