Note: "A DH That Matters" is the introduction to Debates in the Digital Humanities 2019 and it is freely available to read on Manifold.

However, because incarcerated students usually do not have access to the internet, they will not be able to read it on Manifold. We are therefore writing to the University of Minnesota Press to request permission to reproduce the full text in the course site for college-in-prison, so that students can read it offline.   

Note to students: we are choosing to read the introduction to the most recent edition of Debates in the Digital Humanities, published in 2019, first. In order to put this introduction in context and to see how thinking about DH has changed over the last few years (and because it is awesome), the following reading on the syllabus is the introduction to the 2016 edition of Debates in the Digital Humanities, "Digital Humanities: The Expanded Field" by Matthew K. Gold and Lauren F. Klein. After that we will go further back in time and read the introduction to the first edition of Debates in the Digital Humanities published in 2012, "The Digital Humanities Moment" by Matthew K. Gold.
