Git is version control software used to track the state of files associated with a project. Users can take snapshots of files, travel through the history of a project, collaborate transparently with others, and easily keep compatible data in many locations.

In this session, we'll learn what makes Git such a powerful tool for both collaborative and individual projects. This session will show how to use Git for a variety of digital undertakings, including collaborating with others and sharing your work. This session covers initializing Git repositories, committing changes, and copying repositories to your local machine.

To complete this workshop, you will need to have VS Code and Git installed on your local machine. We have probably installed them already, but to make sure they are installed, in your terminal type code --version to make sure that you have VS Code and git --version to make sure that you have Git properly installed.
