Many of us have had some interaction with computers, and would be able to explain what a screen and a cursor are, and then show how to point and click on icons. When we do this, we are relying on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced "gooey!").

In this session we are going to explore another way to make a computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we will be typing in the laptop's terminal to tell the computer directly what task to perform.

While this new technique can seem intimidating if you have not used text-based interfaces before, luckily, you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.

In this session, we will:

* learn common commands to create files (touch and echo)
* learn commands to create directories (mkdir)
* navigate our file structure using change directory (cd), print working directory (pwd), and list (ls)
* move content from one place to another using redirects (>) and pipes (|)
* explore a comma separated values (.csv) dataset using word and line counts, head and tail, and the concatenate command cat
* search text files using the grep command
* create and sort cheat sheets for the commands we learn
