These notes are mainly to keep track of where things are. Some resources will be on the external hard drive, others in student USB flash drives, and others will be printed on paper and physically given to students.

It is a good idea to assign one laptop and one USB flash drive per student for the duration of the whole course. USB flash drives should be kept securely with the laptops. No students should take their USB flash drives out of the classroom. It is a good idea to have students sign a document acknowledging receipt of their assigned USB flash drive and their assigned laptop at the beginning of the course. It is also a good idea to have a few unassigned USB flash drives in case any become damaged or get erased.

Most of the resources for technical skills sessions are on this course site in each tutorial session. These are not listed here. Other resources which are too large or too fiddly to put on the course site will be in clearly named folders on all the USB flash drives, or maybe on an external hard drive. The resources on USB flash drives or an external hard drive are listed here.
