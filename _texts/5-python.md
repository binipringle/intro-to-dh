Python is a general-purpose programming language that is suitable for a wide variety of core tasks in the digital humanities. Learning Python fundamentals is a gateway to analyzing data, creating visualizations, composing interactive websites, scraping the internet, and engaging in distant reading of texts.

By the end of this workshop, participants will:

    Understand what Python is and, in general terms, what it can do.
    Run Python programs, both by interacting directly with the interpreter and by preparing and running scripts.
    Distinguish among five core data typesâ€”integers, floats, strings, booleans, and lists.
    Become familiar with core programming concepts, including variables, loops, and conditionals.
    Engage with error output and use the internet and documentation to independently research language features.
    Learn how to find and import code from external sources to solve more complex problems.

## Footnotes

[^fn1]:

	The author had just landed in La Guardia Airport after the flight captain died. All the passengers stood up to applaud the co-pilot. We have it in good authority that the event in question led Yoko Ono to write her "Letter to John":

	> - On a windy day let's go flying
	> - There may be no trees to rest on
	> - There may be no clouds to ride
	> - But we'll have our wings and the wind will be with us
	> - That's enough for me, that's enough for me.
	{:.poetry}

[^fn2]: The bugle is a small trumpet implicated in the military industrial complex.

[^fn3]: Another footnote. Why not?
